		<h2>Basic Ideas</h2>
		<p>Basketball is one of the most popular sports in America. Want to finally find out what all they hype is about? So here's the deal. In basketball, the main objective is to score the ball in the hoop, and outscore your opponent. On the court, there are 10 players playing at all times. 5 from each team. However, they are not randomly assigned. They each have their own individual role as all 5 have different positions. The five positions are:
			<div class="court">
			<ul>
				<li>Point Guard</li>
				<li>Shooting Guard</li>
				<li>Small Forward</li>
				<li>Power Forward</li>
				<li>Center</li>
			</ul>

			</div>

			<br>
		<p class="p-3">They all in their own way contribute to score. There are three different ways to score points in basketball. If a player shoots the ball and makes it from behind the three point line, which is the farthest arc from the hoop, then they receive 3 points. If the player shoots the ball and makes it into the hoop from anywhere inside that arc, then it only counts as 2 points. If a player is fouled, depending from where they are on the court, they receive free throw shots. For example, if a player is fouled from outside the three point line, then they receive 3 free throw shots to make up for the 3 points that could have been scored. If they are fouled from inside the 3 point line where the shot would have been worth 2 points, then they are given 2 free throw shots. These free throw shots are taken from the free throw line, and every shot that is made counts as 1 point.</p>
