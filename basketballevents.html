			</div>
		<p>These matchups were determined through the regular season and seeding rules. Along with the Play-In Tournament, where the bottom seeds in each conference played an elimination style tournament to determine who gets the 7th and 8th seed. Through this tournament, the Golden State Warriors, San Antonio Spurs, Indiana Pacers, and Charlotee Hornets were eliminated. The Milwaukee Bucks and Miami Heat have actually finished their series, as the Bucks swept the Heat in 4 games. So they will wait to see who else advances as the rest of the series are yet to be determined.</p>
