		<h2>Basic Ideas</h2>
		<p>American Football is arguably the most popular sport in America. So it makes sense you want to learn its rules! So what are the rules for the game? In very simple terms, American Football consists of two teams trying to score points until time runs out. Both teams are only allowed to have a maximum of 11 players. Like in any other sport, one team is on the offense, and the other team is on the defense. The team on offense, is the team trying to score points, meanwhile the team on defense, is trying to stop that team from scoring. Ever heard the phrases it's "First Down," or "Second Down" or "Third Down?" "Downs" are basically chances that a team has to gain 10 yards from where they start. Every team gets 4 downs. Usually there may be a number after a down, like "it's Second and 4." This simply means that it is the teams second chance, and they are 4 yards away from gaining 10 yards. If the team gets those 4 yards within the next two tries, then they are granted 4 more tries to get another 10 yards. This keeps occuring until the team is stopped by the defense, they run out of tries without gaining 10 yards, or they score a touchdown.</p>

			<li>Yards: The unit of measurement on the field</li>
			<li>Endzone: Parts of the end of the fields that have team representation (ie: City,State,Team Name,Logo, etc). If a team gets the ball inside this part of the field, they score a touchdown.</li>
			<li>Touchdown: Term used when a team scores. Each Touchdown is worth 6 points.</li>
			<li>Extra Point: After a team has scored a touchdown, that team can score an extra point (hence the name). They can do this by kicking the ball through the Goal Post</li>
			<li>Goal Post: Large yellow metal posts on opposite sides of the field...you can't miss them...</li>
			<li>Red Zone: The Red Zone includes the 20 yards closest to a team's Endzone.</li>
			<li>Goal Line: White line separating the Endzone from the rest of the field.</li>
			<li>Punt: One team kicks away the ball to another team, signifies a change of possesion.</li>
			<li>Penalty: A foul commited by one team that results in a small advantage given to the other team. This advantage can be yards given, or 4 more tries.</li>
