		<h2>Basic Ideas</h2>
		<p>Baseball is another popular American sport. Similar to other sports, the main idea of Baseball is to be able to outscore the opponent. However, points are not socred through shooting or through touchdowns. They are scored through runs. A run in baseball is when a player hits the ball in between the foul lines and out of the field. However, that is not the only way to score. There are 4 bases, 1st base, 2nd base, 3rd base, and Home Plate. When a player is on third base, and the batter hits a fair ball, the player on base can run to homme plate and it would count as a run. Players on all bases can keep running to home base until they think they will be tagged out. 9 players from one team are allowed on the field at once. Those 9 players switch between offense and defense, similar to how basketball players must play both offense and defense. There are 9 innings in each game, which in Baseball terminology, is similar to a quarter in other sports. If the game is tied and more innings are required, then both teams receive extra innings under extra inning rules.</p>
